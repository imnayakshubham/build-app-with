# 🚀 Build App With

**The fastest way to create modern web applications**

An interactive CLI tool that helps you quickly set up production-ready web applications with popular frameworks and features - no complex configuration needed.

## 🎯 What can you build?

### Frontend Applications
- **⚛️ React with Next.js** - Full-stack React framework with server-side rendering
- **⚡ React with Vite** - Lightning-fast React development with modern tooling

### Backend APIs
- **🚀 Express.js** - Traditional Node.js web server with extensive ecosystem
- **⚡ Fastify** - High-performance Node.js framework for APIs

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **⚠️ Important**: This is a CLI tool. Don't use `npm i build-app-with` - that won't work!

### ✨ Recommended: Use directly (no installation needed)
```bash
npx build-app-with my-awesome-app
```

### 📦 Or install globally for repeated use
```bash
npm install -g build-app-with
build-app-with my-app
```

## 💡 How it works

1. **Choose your framework** - React (Next.js/Vite) or Node.js (Express/Fastify)
